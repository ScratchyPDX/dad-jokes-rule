          <p>
            Years ago, we were on a family road trip and silence permeated the interior of our Suburban. 
            The monotonous hours of driving had taken their toll. Game play had ended hours before, excited 
            talk about our destination had waned and a sense of boredom pervaded. Just then, we passed a sign 
            indicating the approach of a large dam, informing travelers of daily guided tours. All I asked 
            was “Want to take a dam tour?” Laughter exploded in the car and excitement returned. Jokes about 
            “the dam gift shop”, “the dam tour guide”, and whether there would be “dam snacks” available filled 
            car and brought life back into the once lifeless space. We talked and made more jokes for several 
            hours until we finally arrived at our destination. Today, we cannot pass by a dam without those 
            jokes being repeated…and we all laugh.
